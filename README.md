# Task-04: Hand Gesture Recognition Model

## Project Overview
This project, undertaken at Prodigy Infotech, focuses on developing a hand gesture recognition model capable of accurately identifying and classifying different hand gestures from images or video data. The model aims to enhance human-computer interaction by enabling gesture-based control systems, offering an intuitive way to interact with technology.

## Dataset Information

### Source
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed through the following link:

[Kaggle Dataset - Leap Motion Hand Gesture Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog)

### Dataset Structure
The dataset consists of images representing various hand gestures, which are categorized into multiple classes. Each class corresponds to a different gesture, and the images are organized accordingly. The dataset is ideal for training machine learning models to recognize and classify hand gestures.

### Dataset Details:
- Number of Classes: Various hand gestures.
- Data Type: Image data.

## Model Implementation

### Objectives:
- Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from hand gesture images.
- Model Training: Train a machine learning model that can accurately classify different hand gestures.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance and accuracy in identifying gestures.

### Key Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Normalize and resize images to prepare them for model training.
   
2. Feature Extraction:
   - Extract key features from the images to be used for gesture classification.

3. Model Training:
   - Train the model using the processed dataset to recognize and classify the different hand gestures.

4. Model Evaluation:
   - Assess the model's performance using a test dataset to ensure it can accurately identify gestures.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (for model development)
- NumPy
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- Jupyter Notebook (recommended for running the code)

### How to Run

1. Install the necessary libraries:
  
   pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python
   
2. Download and set up the dataset:
   - Download the dataset from Kaggle and organize it according to the required structure.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook file included in this project and execute the cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Conclusion
This project is a step forward in creating more intuitive and natural user interfaces by enabling machines to understand human gestures. The hand gesture recognition model developed here can be integrated into various applications, including gesture-based control systems and human-computer interaction interfaces.
